## Description

This is a crypto theft using  network traffic capture (PCAP) of the theft 

Challenge Description:

>ReachKart is an e-commerce website running on Ehtereum blockchain technology, to support rapid development without disrupting the live environment, the company implemented a "production mirror" strategy, creating an exact replica of the production environment for development and testing purposes. The mirror includes replicated databases, services and blockchain nodes, but it appears that customer data has not been anonymized. Customer support is now receiving emails from sellers complaining that their wallets are missing ether. You have to investigate and understand if and how an intrusion has occurred.
